// Ok so here is my code. What i want here to be. First of all the core system of the app is the pibt itself. Yes, there is pibt that allows for cell by cell movement. But i might not need it. For now i want a semi working prototype. What i want is an aggressive movement with paths such that they do not intersect. I basically want to avoid collisions of squarish objects. I would start this with something very simple. First of all, we do not actually need those cells in this case? is it true? If this is the case, then we can just draw something very simple.
